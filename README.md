# Lightening Talk: WebGL


## History 
WebGL evolved out of the Canvas 3D experiments started by Vladimir Vukićević at Mozilla. (Then: Director of Engineering a Mozilla) He now is working at Unity Labs. He demonstrated the first protype of 3D rendering on to the Canvas element in 2006.

Development of the WebGL 2 specification started in 2013 and was finalized in January 2017. 

Browsers that first implemented via the specification: 
Firefox 51, Chrome 56, and Opera 43.


## Developing directly with WebGL


> If you’re a graphics genius with a PHD in Mathematics, this is definitely the way to go. For most of us mere mortals, I don’t recommend it.

> Using pure WebGL is the equivalent of learning and programming directly in assembly language, when you could be using a language like C++ to make your life easier.


## Frameworks 

WebGL frameworks abstract away a lot of the difficult parts of webGL.


### <b>[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)</b>

The most widly used framework for coding webGL.

First released in April of 2010 by Ricardo Cabello (Mr. Doob). Was originally developed in ActionScript, which is where I first learned about the libary.

Three.js is currently in use in the digital equifit 

Some great examples of three.js in the wild:<br/>

[Video & Transitions](http://taotajima.jp/)<br/>
[Stars & Scaling](http://stars.chromeexperiments.com/)



### <b>[Unity](https://unity.com/)</b>




### <b>[Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/)</b>
